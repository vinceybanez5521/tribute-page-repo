          Filipino world boxing champion Manny Pacquiao began boxing professionally at age 16. After beating Thailand's
          Chatchai
          Sasakul to win the WBC flyweight championship in 1998, he continued to overwhelm his era's top competitors en
          route to
          titles in eight separate weight divisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          He is the only boxer in history to have won twelve major world titles in eight different weight divisions.
          Pacquiao
          achieved the feat when he defeated Antonio Margarito via a unanimous decision to win the WBC super
          welterweight title
          on
          November 13, 2010 at the Cowboys Stadium, Arlington, Texas, USA.

          Emmanuel Dapidran Pacquiao was born on December 17, 1978, to parents Dionesia Dapidran-Pacquiao and Rosalio
          Pacquiao. He
          was raised in Kibawe, which is located in the Bukidnon province of Mindanao, Philippines.
        </p>
        <p>
          When he was a
          teenager,
          Pacquiao left his family and boarded a ship to Manila, Philippines, in hopes of training as a boxer and
          launching a
          career in the sport. Not long after, in January of 1995, his goals gained some traction; at age 16, he stepped
          into the
          ring for his first professional bout, against Edmund Ignacio. Pacquiao won the fight in four rounds, in a
          unanimous
          decision. The victory propelled him on a successful boxing run that would encompass the better part of two
          decades.

      <h2>Boxing Career</h2>
      <p>Here is a timeline of Pacquiao's boxing career:</p>
      <ul id="timeline">
        <li>At the age of 14, Pacquiao moved to Manila where he became part of the Philippine national amateur boxing
          team. He has
          an amateur record of 60-4.</li>
        <li>On January 22, 1995, Pacquiao made his professional debut in a four-round bout in the light flyweight
          division against
          Edmund "Enting" Ignacio and won.</li>
        <li>Pacquiao captured the WBC and lineal flyweight titles (his first major boxing world title) over Chatchai
          Sasakul by way
          of knockout in the eighth round. He defended the titles successfully against Mexican Gabriel Mira via a
          fourth-round technical knockout. However,
          Pacquiao lost the lineal title in his second defense against Medgoen Singsurat</li>
        <li>Following his loss to Singsurat, Pacquiao gained weight and skipped the super-flyweight and bantamweight
          divisions. This
          time, Pacquiao went to super-bantamweight division of 122 pounds, where he picked up the WBC International
          super-bantamweight title. He defended this title five times before his chance for a world title fight came.
        </li>
        <li>Pacquiao's big break came on June 23, 2001, against IBF super-bantamweight title holder Lehlohonolo Ledwaba.
          Pacquiao
          stepped into the fight as a late replacement on two weeks' notice but won the fight by technical knockout to
          win the
          title, his second major boxing world title.</li>
        <li>Pacquiao faced Agapito Sánchez in a unification match on November 10, 2001, at the Bill Graham Civic
          Auditorium in San
          Francisco, California as the main supporting bout of Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Jesús Chávez. This marks both
          Mayweather
          and Pacquiao first appearance together in the same fight card. The bout ended in the sixth round under the
          recommendation of the ringside physician to stop the fight as Pacquiao was unfit to continue due to the cuts
          inflicted
          by Sanchez's repeated headbutts. The bout was ruled a split draw.</li>
        <li>Pacquiao knocked out Jorge Eliecer Julio in the second round on June 8, 2002, at The Pyramid in Memphis,
          Tennessee as
          the main supporting bout of Lennox Lewis vs. Mike Tyson fight. This marks Pacquiao's first appearance in a
          joint HBO and
          Showtime fight card.</li>
        <li>On November 15, 2003, Pacquiao faced Marco Antonio Barrera at the Alamodome, San Antonio, Texas, in a fight
          that many
          consider to have defined his career. Pacquiao, who was fighting at featherweight for the first time,
          brought his
          power with him and defeated Barrera via technical knockout in the eleventh round.</li>
        <li>Six months after the fight with Barrera, Pacquiao challenged Juan Manuel Márquez, who at the time held both
          the WBA and
          IBF featherweight titles. The bout was scored a draw, which proved to be a controversial decision.[44] The
          final scores were 115-110 for Márquez,
          115-110 for Pacquiao, and 113-113. The judge who scored the bout 113-113 admitted to making an error on
          the
          scorecards, having scored the first round as 10-7 in favor of Pacquiao instead of the standard 10-6 for a
          three-knockdown round. If he had scored the round 10-6 for Pacquiao (as the other two judges did), the result
          would have
          been a split decision in favor of Pacquiao.</li>
        <li>On March 19, 2005, Pacquiao moved up to the super-featherweight (or junior-lightweight) division of 130
          pounds to fight
          another Mexican legend and three-division world champion Érik Morales, for the vacant WBC International and
          vacant IBA
          super-featherweight titles. The fight took place at the MGM Grand Garden Arena, Las Vegas. In this fight,
          Pacquiao
          sustained a cut over his right eye from an accidental clash of heads in the fifth round. He lost the
          twelve-round match
          by a unanimous decision from the judges</li>
        <li>On September 10, 2005, Pacquiao knocked Héctor Velázquez out in six rounds at Staples Center in Los Angeles
          to capture
          the WBC International super-featherweight title, which he went on to defend five times. On the same card, his
          rival
          Morales fought Zahir Raheem and lost via unanimous decision in the main event.</li>
        <li>Despite Morales's loss to Raheem, Pacquiao got matched up against him in a rematch which took place on
          January 21, 2006,
          at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas. During the fight, Morales escaped being knocked down twice, once in
          the second
          round by holding onto the ropes and once in the sixth by falling on the referee. Pacquiao eventually stopped
          Morales in
          the tenth with a TKO, the first time Morales was stopped in his boxing career.</li>
        <li>On July 2, 2006, Pacquiao defended his WBC International title against Óscar Larios, a two-time
          super-bantamweight
          champion who had moved up two weight divisions to fight Pacquiao. Pacquiao won the fight via unanimous
          decision,
          knocking down Larios two times in the twelve-round bout at the Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City, Philippines.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pacquiao and Morales fought a third time (with the series tied 1-1) on November 18, 2006. Witnessed by a
          near-record
          crowd of 18,276, the match saw Pacquiao defeat Morales via a third-round knockout at the Thomas & Mack Center
          in Las
          Vegas.
        </li>
        <li>After a failed promotional negotiation with Marco Antonio Barrera's camp, Bob Arum chose Jorge Solís as
          Pacquiao's next
          opponent among several fighters Arum offered as replacements. The bout was held in San Antonio, Texas, on
          April 14,
          2007. In the sixth round, an accidental headbutt occurred, giving Pacquiao a cut under his left eyebrow. The
          fight ended
          in the eighth when Pacquiao knocked Solís down twice. Solís barely beat the count after the second knockdown,
          causing
          the referee to stop the fight and award Pacquiao a knockout win.</li>
        <li>On October 6, 2007, Pacquiao defeated Barrera in their rematch via an easy unanimous decision. In the
          eleventh round,
          Pacquiao's punch caused a deep cut below Barrera's right eye.</li>
        <li>On March 15, 2008, in a rematch against Juan Manuel Márquez, called "Unfinished Business," Pacquiao won via
          split
          decision.</li>
        <li>On June 28, 2008, at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, Pacquiao moved to the lightweight
          division and
          claimed the WBC lightweight title, defeating David Díaz via knockout in round nine. With the victory, Pacquiao
          became
          the first and only Filipino and Asian to become a five-division world champion, a fighter who won world titles
          in five
          different weight divisions.</li>
        <li>On December 6, 2008, Pacquiao moved up to the welterweight division to face the six-division world champion
          Oscar De La
          Hoya at the MGM Grand Garden Arena, in a fight called "The Dream Match". Pacquiao dominated the fight and,
          after eight rounds, De La Hoya's
          corner was
          forced to throw in the towel, awarding Pacquiao the win via technical knockout.</li>
        <li>
          On May 2, 2009, Pacquiao fought at light-welterweight for the first time against Ricky Hatton at the MGM Grand
          Garden
          Arena, in a fight billed as "The Battle of the East and West." Pacquiao won the bout via knockout to claim
          Hatton's IBO,
          The Ring and lineal light-welterweight titles.
        </li>
        <li>On November 14, 2009, Pacquiao defeated Miguel Cotto via technical knockout in the twelfth round at the MGM
          Grand Garden
          Arena, in a fight billed as "Firepower."</li>
        <li>On March 13, 2010, at the Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, Pacquiao defeated Clottey via unanimous
          decision to
          retain his WBO welterweight title.</li>
        <li>On July 23, 2010, Bob Arum announced that Pacquiao would fight Antonio Margarito on November 13, 2010. The
          fight for the
          vacant WBC super-welterweight title gave Pacquiao the chance to win a world title in his eighth weight class,
          the
          super-welterweight division. In the fight, Pacquiao defeated Margarito via unanimous decision, using his
          superior handspeed and movement to win his
          eighth world title in as many divisions. In the penultimate round, Pacquiao implored referee Laurence Cole
          several times
          to stop the fight as Margarito had a swollen face and a large cut beneath the right eye, but the referee let
          the fight
          continue. Margarito had to be taken directly to the hospital after the fight, where it was discovered his
          orbital bone had been
          fractured; he had to undergo surgery.</li>
        <li>On May 7, 2011, Pacquiao successfully defended his WBO welterweight title against three-division world
          champion Shane
          Mosley via lopsided unanimous decision at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.</li>
        <li>On November 12, Pacquiao defeated Márquez via majority decision 114-114, 115-113, and 116-112.</li>
        <li>On February 5, Bob Arum announced Timothy Bradley as Pacquiao's next opponent on June 9 for his WBO
          welterweight title. Pacquiao lost the bout in a controversial split decision, scoring 115-113, 113-115, and
          113-115 from the three judges.
          The decision was booed by the crowd and criticized by many news outlets who were independently scoring the
          fight.
          However, Pacquiao was gracious in defeat and Bradley called for a rematch.</li>
        <li>Pacquiao fought Juan Manuel Márquez on December 8, 2012. The fight was for the WBO's "Champion of the
          Decade" belt. Márquez knocked down Pacquiao in the third round with a looping right hook. In round five,
          Pacquiao returned the favor,
          knocking down Márquez. Pacquiao went on the offensive in the sixth round. While behind the scorecards and with
          just one
          second left in the sixth round, Márquez countered Pacquiao's jab with an overhand right, sending Pacquiao face
          first to
          the canvas, resulting in a knockout. Pacquiao, who had not been knocked out in over 13 years since his loss to
          Medgoen
          Singsurat in 1999, remained unconscious for several minutes.</li>
        <li>After 11 months away from boxing, Pacquiao returned to the ring on November 24, 2013, at The Venetian Macao
          Hotel &
          Resort's Cotai Arena in Macau of the Special administrative regions in China against The Ring ranked No. 6
          light-welterweight: Brandon Ríos, for the vacant WBO International welterweight title. This was Pacquiao's
          first fight
          to be held in China. Pacquiao won the match by unanimous decision.</li>
        <li>Following his victory over Rios, Pacquiao sought out and ultimately got a rematch with the WBO welterweight
          champion of
          the world: Timothy Bradley. In a tough fight, Pacquiao came on the stronger of the two fighters throughout the
          later rounds of the fight to end up
          gaining a unanimous decision victory from the judges 118-110, 116-112, and 116-112.</li>
        <li>Pacquiao faced undefeated WBO light-welterweight champion Chris Algieri in Macau on November 23, 2014, for
          Pacquiao's
          welterweight title. Pacquiao dominated the bout and scored six official knockdowns en route to a lopsided
          victory via
          unanimous decision</li>
        <li>Pacquiao fought Floyd Mayweather Jr. in Las Vegas at the MGM Grand Garden Arena on May 2, 2015. After years
          of
          tumultuous negotiations, the two finally met in the ring, Pacquiao with the intent to be the aggressor and
          Mayweather
          with the strategy of diffuse and counter. The fight went the distance and to the official judges' scorecards
          which read
          118-110, 116-112, and 116-112 in favor of Mayweather. After the fight, Pacquiao decided his temporary
          retirement.</li>
        <li>On March 27, Arum told the International Business Times (IBT) that Pacquiao vs. Horn was back on. In front
          of 51,052, Pacquiao lost a hard-fought fight via a controversial unanimous decision when the three judges
          scored it 117-111, 115-113, and 115-113 in favor of Horn.</li>
        <li>On April 2, Pacquiao vs Matthysse was officially confirmed for July 14, US time in Kuala Lumpur,
          Malaysia.Pacquiao would go into the fight without long-time trainer Freddie Roach and instead be trained by
          his life-long friend
          Buboy Fernandez. The fight took place at the Axiata Arena. Pacquiao scored his first knockout in over eight
          years by stopping Matthysse
          in round seven to win the WBA (Regular) welterweight title.</li>
        <li>On January 19, 2019, Pacquiao successfully defended his WBA (Regular) welterweight title against Broner via
          unanimous decision
          and never
          seemed troubled throughout the fight.</li>
        <li>Pacquiao defeated Keith Thurman via split decision for Thurman's WBA (Super) welterweight title on July 20,
          2019, in Las
          Vegas at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.</li>
        <li>On August 10, the bout against Spence was cancelled because of Spence's eye injury and is replaced by
          Yordenis Ugás. The bout was a competitive affair, with Ugás using his jab and looping right hand effectively
          to control the distance.
          While Pacquiao had moments of success throughout the night, he never truly settled into a rhythm and was
          noticeably
          stiffer than usual, not showcasing the deft footwork that he has been known for throughout his career. At the
          final bell, Ugás was awarded a unanimous decision victory.</li>
        <li>On September 29, 2021, Pacquiao officially announced his retirement from boxing in a post on social media.
        </li>
        <li>On December 11, 2022, in the Korea International Exhibition Center, Pacquiao fought a 6 round exhibition
          match against
          South Korean martial artist, DK Yoo. Pacquiao won the exhibition by unanimous decision.</li>
